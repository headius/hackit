      <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">This is a complete
      listing of my comments form the very first version to the current one.
      It's actually a pretty good read.</P>
      <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">(Note: I am trying
      to find copies of the older legacy versions, which have long since been
      lost. <A HREF="http://www.headius.com/contact.html">Please contact us</A>

          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">Top-It! -
          Ancient ancestor to Hack-It! Written in visual basic, this program
          just made a window stay on top. You had to type in the name of the
          window, hit a button, and zing! It was topped. Never released, except
          to a few friends.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">Hack-It! v1.0 -
          First release version Very basic, nothing special to it, just choose
          the window to act on and press a button. Basic Layout: Two listboxes,
          one for visible windows and one for hidden windows. Buttons for the
          first list: Top-It!, Hide-It!, Un-Top-It!. Buttons for the second
          list: Top-It!, Un-Hide-It!, Un-Top-It!.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v1.1 - Not
          released. Added the Auto-Top list which allows the use of wildcards to
          choose certain windows that will always be &quot;topped&quot;
          automatically. Basic Layout of Auto-Top dialogs: List of wildcard
          specs, with buttons to add, edit, and delete them.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v1.11 - Second
          release version Bugfix to v1.1. No new features.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v1.12 - Re-Bugfix
          to 1.11 Apparently, that last .01 didn't cut it.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v2.0b - Version
          2.0 beta 1. Added the Tray-It! feature, and cleaned up a few things.
          Still has some problems that are being difficult with me. Tray-It!
          allows you to run any program &quot;on&quot; the tray. It's nice for
          programs that you don't normally need to have shown, but that you run
          for long periods of time.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v2.0 - Version
          2.0. I FINALLY found the problem with the beta. It all works well now,
          but I have new ideas already. 2.1 is in the works, and 3.0 is on the
          board.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v3.0b1 -
          Version 3.0 beta 1. I skipped 2.1 (too many new things) and went right
          to 3.0. This is a complete rewrite of the original program, and so far
          it runs much cleaner and seemingly with less memory. Many new
          features, but most don't work quite yet (wanted to get this out so you
          could offer input *HINT HINT EMAIL HINT HINT*). Layout: Four tabs, for
          Visible Windows, Hidden Windows, Auto, and About. No help implemented
          yet... do you think I should?</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v3.0b2 -
          Version 3.0 beta 2. I managed to get the interface all set...but
          nothing works yet.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v3.0b3 -
          Version 3.0 beta 3. All windows will have icons now...some will get
          the default &quot;Windows Logo&quot; icon, simply cuz' they don't have
          another one reg'd. Auto-Top and Auto-Hide are working...still trying
          to find a clean way to handle Auto-Tray, but it won't be long now.
          Still can't get trayyed programs to behave. Tray-It really doesnt'
          work well yet, try to avoid it, I'll have a new beta out before long.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v3.0b4 -
          Version 3.0 beta 4 I am limiting the Tray-It! slots to 20, to make
          things cleaner. Trayyed programs now act like they did in v2.0, it
          worked well then, I'll modify it to the recent standard once
          everything else is working. A few bugs have been cleaned up, code
          improved, but the biggest addition is the new splash screen, donated
          by Ashadi Hopper, a new aussie friend of mine.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v3.0b5 -
          Version 3.0 beta 5 - FINAL BETA I found a smooth way to handle
          Tray-It! slots, so they are back to as many as you like, and they
          behave very well now. You cannot tray the same program twice anymore.
          All auto functions work and the auto list is saved to
          d:\WINDOWS\HACKIT3.INI (d = your windows drive). This should be the
          last v3 beta, unless something AMAZING comes up.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v3.0p - Version
          3.0p (Prerelease). Only sent to people who sent me email. Prerelease,
          final bug check.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v3.0i - Version
          3.0i (Incomplete). Incomplete. I'm sick of Delphi for now.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v4.0b1 -
          Version 4.0 beta 1. Version 3.0 is no more. There were too many
          problems with Delphi to make a system util like Hack-It! run cleanly.
          This version will knock yer socks off and curl your hair. Too much to
          explain - run it and see for yerself.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v4.0b2 -
          Version 4.0 beta 2. Getting there! Trayying works now, but it's choppy
          and unstable. A temporary setup at best. Be careful with it. There's
          an elusive memory leak somewhere in the &quot;add child windows to
          window list&quot; routine, let me know what kinda of errors you might
          get, I'm having trouble tracking it down. The child windows and funky
          windows are immense fun to play around with, and YES you can tray
          child windows. You can even tray the Start button if you are so
          inclined, although I don't know why you'd want to do that. Have fun,
          be careful, keep reports/donations coming!</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v4.0b3 -
          Version 4.0 beta 3. Wowie...it's getting powerful. I don't know if I
          can keep it reined for much longer. Anyway, priority setting and end
          task are in place, the menu has been redesigned, and the memory leak
          has been fixed. It still GPF's once in a while, let me know any info
          you pick up on this. I grow weary polling for donations, lets not make
          this a shareware program, shall we not? Donations: 3216 Leyland Tr,

          - Version 4.0 beta 4</A>. TRAYYED ICONS! AUTOREFRESH! AUTO FUNCTIONS!
          It's been a busy couple of weeks, but I managed to get over the
          largest problem I had to tackle - AUTOMATICALLY refreshing the window
          list. But now it works, well-behaving tray icons and auto functions
          followed, and suddenly, a final version is drawing into view. One,
          maybe two more betas guys, and I'll have a nice finished version for
          yas. Have fun, donate some change, drop me AS MUCH MAIL AS POSSIBLE.</P>

          - Version 4.0 beta 6</A>. Wooo. Child windows are fully functional
          now, and I've started to include more features that y'all have
          suggested. I know you'll all like this one, and if things go well,
          I'll have even more features implemented this month, like drag-drop,
          edit functions, more...keep the great suggestions coming in guys, they
          help me know what you all want. Please consider purchasing the PRO
          version for only $15! One check and you'll be a PRO user for life! See
          PROINFO.TXT for info.</P>

          - Version 4.0 beta 7</A>. Lots of new additions and cleanups, much
          smoother refreshing, autofunctions for children, better context menu,
          Drag and Drop, minimize to tray, help file, autofunction dialog
          cleaned up, moving ever closer to final.</P>

          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in"><A HREF="http://www.headius.com/files/hackit4b8.zip">v4.0b8
          - Version 4.0 beta 8</A>. This version even thrills me. Among the many
          improvements are: variable refresh speed, from persistant to 10 second
          delay, settings all saved to registry, configurable Illegal Windows,
          SCRIPTING to replace the old autofunctions (primitive right now, but
          the old stuff all works), context menu on tray icons,
          context-sensitive function menu (depends on the type of window
          selected),minimize, maximize, change Hack-It's font, AND MANY MANY
          MORE. Along with more power comes a higher registration cost. Still,
          it's cheap - $20 registers you for life. Credit card registration is
          forthcoming. Enjoy the new features, and send me email as often as you
          can!</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v4.0b9 –
          Version 4.0 beta 9. Beta 8 was a terrible flop. I released it a little
          over a year ago, and since then I've recieved numerous bug reports and
          requests for new features. I know I sorta abandoned things, but I had
          little choice. As it turned out, most of the bugs were caused by my
          use (or misuse) of Microsoft Foundation Classes. In order to fix them,
          and produce a working NT version of Hack-It, I opted to completely
          rewrite everything using my own collection classes and my own classes
          to replace MFC. Not an easy task by any means - but it is done. Beta 9
          is pure Win32 API, encapsulated in my own C++ objects. It is much
          smaller, much faster, and much cleaner, with the added bonus of not
          requiring any external libraries (save those included in Windows
          itself, of course).</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in">v4.0b9.1 –
          Version 4.0 beta 9.1. This is a small fix to beta 9, correcting some
          problems with the window list and refreshing. The collection classes I
          wrote are certainly not the best and I’m looking into alternatives.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in"><A HREF="http://www.headius.com/files/hackit4b9.zip">v4.0b9.2
          – Version 4.0 beta 9.2</A>. Another small tweak to beta 9.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in"><A HREF="http://www.headius.com/files/hackit4b10.zip">v4.0b10
          – Version 4.0 beta 10</A>. In my opinion, this is the closest thing
          to a release candidate that I’ve ever had. All the collections have
          been replaced with STL template classes, adding a bit of size to the
          executable, but improving the memory handling tenfold. All refreshing
          is done using system hooks, although I am considering reinstating the
          old timed refreshing method for those anti-hook people out there. Many
          other new features make this a viable solution for window
          manipulation. There’s even a decent help file now. I’m proud of
          this version.</P>
        <LI>
          <P CLASS="MsoBodyTextIndent2" STYLE="TEXT-INDENT: 0in"><A HREF="http://www.headius.com/files/hackit4b11.zip">v4.0b11
          -- Version 4.0 beta 11</A>. Beta 10, while almost feature-complete,
          was not the most stable thing in the world. Hopefully I've managed to
          remedy that in this release. I have also not had as much time to spend
          on Hack-It as I would like, but that should change this summer. Expect
          some good things in the next few months.</P>
